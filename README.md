Satchless: less is mo'
======================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mirumee/satchless.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mirumee/satchless) [![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/mirumee/satchless/master.svg)](http://codecov.io/github/mirumee/satchless?branch=master)

------

Satchless is a low-level library that provides base classes, interfaces and patterns to work with while implementing a store. Its goal is to provide you with well-tested core logic to build business logic and UIs upon.

Satchless is not a framework and it will not give you a full-fledged store to work with. If that is what you want and youâ€™re working with Django, check the Saleor project instead.

------

**Warning:** Satchless is still undergoing architectural changes.
