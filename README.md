Satchless: less is mo'
======================

> **Note:** Satchless is no longer actively developed or supported. Use at your own risk!


Satchless is a low-level library that provides base classes, interfaces and patterns to work with while implementing a store. Its goal is to provide you with well-tested core logic to build business logic and UIs upon.

Satchless is not a framework and it will not give you a full-fledged store to work with. If that is what you want and youâ€™re working with Django, check the Saleor project instead.
