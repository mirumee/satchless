Satchless: less is mo'
======================

A pythonic way to deal with lower levels of e-commerce.


Overview
--------

Satchless is a low-level library that provides base classes, interfaces and patterns to work with while implementing a store. Its goal is to provide you with well-tested core logic to build business logic and UIs upon.

Satchless is **not a framework** and it will not give you a full-fledged store to work with. If that is what you want and you're working with Django, check the `Saleor <http://github.com/mirumee/saleor>`_ project instead.
